# raytrace

A basic implementation of software-based raytracing in C++. All output is directly stored in a .ppm file (openable in Photoshop, Gimp, feh, etc.).

Currently the raytracer is capable of:
- Raytracing for an arbitrary number of spheres
- Accurately simulating perspective projection
- Basic shadows

There are plans to expand on the number of features, but even this short list is capable of generating a rudimentary image.
